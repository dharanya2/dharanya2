# 🌟 Pathwise AI - Navigate Your Future with Intelligence

> **Leveraging AI to transform career guidance: A personalized recommendation engine built on data-driven analytics.**
---

## 🚀 Key Features and Enhancements

This platform goes beyond basic path recommendations, integrating advanced analysis and user interaction:

* **📈 Predictive Performance Modeling:** Uses classification models to predict the likelihood of user success in specific academic courses or certification exams based on their current profile and skill scores.
* **🧩 Skill Gap Identification (NEW):** Analyzes the skills required for a target job role and compares them against the user's current skillset (**C, Python, Java, SQL, etc.**), providing a prioritized learning roadmap.
* **🔄 Iterative Profile Refinement:** The system learns from user feedback (e.g., "Was this recommendation useful?") to continually refine the underlying model weights, improving accuracy over time.
* **🌍 Global Rank Benchmarking (Link to CP):** Integrates competitive programming metrics (like your **CodeChef Rating** and **LeetCode Rank**) to provide a quantified benchmark of problem-solving ability against peers, especially for technical roles.
* **🌐 RESTful API Integration:** Designed the back-end to expose recommendation logic via a clean RESTful API, enabling potential future mobile app integration or third-party usage.

## ⚙️ Technical Architecture

The project follows a standard three-tier architecture with a specialized focus on the ML/AI layer.

### 1. Presentation Layer (Frontend)
* **Stack:** **HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript**
* **Role:** User profile creation, recommendation display, and interactive feedback forms.

### 2. Application Layer (Backend & Core Logic)
* **Stack:** **Python** (for core logic and ML deployment)
* **Data Models:** Classification/Clustering algorithms (trained using **Scikit-learn** or **TensorFlow/Keras** for expansion).
* **API:** Developed custom API endpoints for data exchange between the frontend and the ML model.

### 3. Data Layer
* **Stack:** **SQL** (Database Management System)
* **Schema:** Manages user data, skill inventories, job market data, and historical recommendation logs.

## 💻 Code & Implementation Highlights

### A. Machine Learning Pipeline (Python)

The core logic involves training the recommendation model.

> **Data Preprocessing & NLP (Initial Step):**
> * Cleaning and normalizing input data (interests, historical scores) using **Pandas** and **NumPy**.
> * Using basic NLP techniques for feature extraction from text-based interests.

### B. Competitive Programming Integration

My high volume of solved problems on CodeChef (**900+**) and LeetCode (**200+**) demonstrates a strong foundation in data structures, algorithms, and efficient problem-solving, which directly supports the development of complex, optimized AI models.

| Platform | Solved Problems | Rating/Rank Highlight |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CodeChef** | 900+ | Highest Rating: 1300 (Global Rank: 69353) |
| **LeetCode** | 200+ | Global Rank: 276131 (Top 35.11%) |

## 🎓 Academic & Professional Foundation

My approach to this project is grounded in my coursework and practical experience:

* **B.Tech AI&DS Coursework:** Applied concepts from **Database Management Systems (SQL)**, **Computer Networks**, and **Operating Systems** to ensure the platform is robust and scalable.
* **Full-Stack Internship:** The skills gained during my **Full Stack Development Internship** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) were crucial in building the interactive and user-friendly interface.
* **ML Internship:** The hands-on experience in implementing algorithms (Regression, Classification, Clustering) using **NumPy** and **Scikit-learn** provided the basis for the recommendation engine.
